# Part II: Arrays

*Note: Before getting started on these exercises, please be certain that you've read through the root [README.md](../README.md) file in this repository.*

## Exercises

### Basic Requirements

#### Creating Arrays

1. Using the array: `["cat", "fox", "dog", "monkey"]`, what is the index of:

   + "dog"?
   + "monkey"?
   + "cat"?


2. Fix the syntax/style in the following arrays:

  ```js
  [ 1, 3 4 7,9, ]
  "the""quick""brown","fox" "jumped","over" the lazy, "dog",  ]
  [true false,true
  ```

3. Create arrays in the *global scope* of your program consisting of strings that represent:

   + Your favorite TV shows/movies
   + Names of people you know/care about
   + Favorite sports/activities

#### Accessing Array Elements

1. Using the arrays that you created in the last exercise, use the console to access:

    + First elements,
    + Last elements,
    + Other elements!

2. Write a function `first` that takes an array as an argument and returns the
   first element in that array.

3. Write a function `last` that takes an array as an argument and returns the
   *last* element in the array. **Hint:** What is the relationship between the
   *index* of the last element in the array and the *length* of the array?

#### Modifying Arrays

1. Using `push` and `unshift`, make this array contain the
   numbers from zero through seven:

   ```js
   var arr = [2, 3, 4];
   // your code here
   arr; // => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   ```

2. What is *returned* by `push`? Before throwing this into the console, form a
   hypothesis about what you think the return value will be:

   ```js
   var arr = [5, 7, 9];
   arr.push(6); // => ???
   ```

   Were you correct? What is the returned by `push`? Does `unshift` work in the
   same way?

3. We can use the *assignment operator* (`=`) to replace elements in arrays with
   other ones like so:

   ```js
   var animals = ['dog', 'elephant', 'zebra']
   // let's replace 'dog' with 'hippo'
   animals[0] = 'hippo';
   animals; // => ['hippo', 'elephant', 'zebra']
   ```

   Using the same principle, perform the following:

   ```js
   // 1. Change all odd numbers to be those numbers multiplied by two:
   var numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];
   // TODO: your code here
   numbers; // => [4, 18, 14, 2, 2, 8]

   // 2. Fix the typos by replacing each element with a correctly spelled version
   var places = ['snfranisco', 'oacklannd', 'santacrus']
   // TODO: your code here
   places; // => ['san francisco', 'oakland', 'santa cruz']
   ```

### More Practice

1. Write a function called `nth` that accepts an array and an index as
   parameters, and returns the element at that index.

   ```js
   function nth(array, index) {
     // TODO: your code here
   }
   var animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'gerbil'];
   nth(animals, 2); // => 'gerbil'
   nth(animals, 1) === animals[1]; // => true
   ```

2. Write a function `rest` that returns all the elements in the array *except*
   for the first one. **HINT:** Read about the `slice` method on
   [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)
   and/or experiment with `slice` at the console like so:

   ```js
   var numbers = [3, 2, 7, 5];
   numbers.slice(0);
   numbers.slice(1);
   numbers.slice(2);
   numbers.slice(0, 2);
   ```

3. Write a function `butlast` that returns all of the elements in the array
   *except* for the last one (you may want to use `slice` for this one as well).

4. Complete the function `cons` that accepts an element and an array, and
   returns an array with the element added to the *front* of the array:

   ```js
   function cons(x, array) {
     // your code here
   }
   ```

5. Complete the function `conj` that accepts an array and an element, and
   returns an array with the element added to the *end* of the array:

   ```js
   function conj(array, x) {
     // your code here
   }
   ```

6. What benefit(s) might there be to using functions like `cons` or `conj` over
   `unshift` or `push`?

7. Try the following in a console:

   ```js
   var arr = [];
   arr[7] = "Hello."
   arr; // => ???
   ```

   What is the value of `arr` after assigning an element to its seventh index?
   Explain the result in plain English.

### Advanced

1. Without running the below function, use a whiteboard to figure out what it
   should return by repeatedly expanding function invocations:

   ```js
   function mystery(array) {
     if (array.length === 0) {
       return [];
     }
     return conj(mystery(rest(array)), first(array));
   }
   ```

2. Using `first`, `rest`, `conj` and/or `cons`, write functions that accomplish
   the following:

   + `sum` all the elements of an array
   + Given an array, returns a new array with each element *squared*
   + Given an array of numbers, returns a new array of just the *even* numbers

  **HINT:** After figuring out how the `mystery` function works above, use it
   as a reference for how to write this type of function.
